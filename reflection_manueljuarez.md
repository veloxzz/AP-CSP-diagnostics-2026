The first thing i did when i opened the repository was try to downald it and copying the code.
The most confusing moment was trying to make a copy of the files as i couldnt figure out how to.
I started clicking random thing and hovering over them until i succesfully found out how to make a copy.
I didnt skip any information i read it and skimmed over it.
I feel more confident on doing things myself as i figured out how to even get here bymyself or just with not clear instructions.
I guess the instructions kinda im just hoping i did everythig right by myself.
