1. First I cloned it then I edited the files then I tried to save the fies into the main folder,
but it was giving me an error saying that I did not have permission to push so then I forked the repository.

2. The most confusin part was starting because I did not know how to clone the repo or make a copy of it.

3. When I got stuck a websit called stock overflow came up that had answers.

4. I just decided to read everything to be safe.

5. I now feel more confident on cloning and editing files on the github website.

6. It is still uncleer why we have to use .md when it just looks like a regular text.
