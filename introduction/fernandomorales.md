I am interested in AP computer Science because technology plays a huge role in everyday life and in fields I'm interested in like science and medicine. I want to understand how computers and programs actually work and not just use them. I would also like yo build problem solving skills that will be useful in the future. 

I am curious about how computing and technology are used in medicine like how could data and algorithms potentially help me to diagnose patients.
