I'm interested in taking the AP Computer Science Principles class because I have always had an interest in computers since a young age and especially since my future career is to beconme a software engineer which requires computer science information.

One thing I'm curios about when it comes to computing or technology is how to code specific software or how to create softawre. For example how to create a website using code such as a website as google.
