I am interested in AP CSP because I have always been amazed by anything associated with technology since I was little. I have always wanted to learn more about computers and technology because I have recently began to think about persuing my career in the technology field. This class also interests me because learning more about technology will help me in my future since we are becoming more of a virtual world as time goes on.

One thing I am curious about is how coding works.
