The first thing I did when I opened this repository was read the insturctions and try to understand the work that had to be done because to be honest I did not understand what to do.
The most condusing moment for me during this process was copying the repository so I can edit it, because I didn't know how to and I was confused by all the buttons on this website.
A strategy I used most was using google to help me mostly with how to create a fork so that I can edit the files and type in them. Another thing I did was ask my brother for help as he does coding and knows how to do some stuff.
At first I read the instructions but I didn't really understand it until I started working on the tasks given, which was when I had to go back and re-read the instrucitons to get a better understanding of them.
What I feel more confident about now is when given tasks, I can complete them with minimum worry as I now know how to work github a bit better than before when I was confused on how to even start.
What still feels unclear is the how I can code in this website or if I can even code/make websites using this app and if I can I believe its going to take a while to become familiar with all the settings and understand how to use them and work them properly.
