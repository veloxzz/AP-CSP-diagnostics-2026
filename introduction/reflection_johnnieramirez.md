1. The first thing I did when I opened this repository was look at all the different buttons and words. I was pretty overwhelmed with all the new information.
   
2.  The most confusing moment was making the copy of the repository. I was really struggling with finding the repository to make a copy of.
   
3.  A stragedy I used was asking a friend for help. They mentioned I had to create a fork. I was confused by what they mean't. However, after finding the link that took me to the repository I was to make a copy of, the mention of a fork really helped me to be able to make my own copy of the repository.

4.  I decided to read all the information given, even the ones without instructions, so I could gain a better understanding of what to do.

5.  I feel more confident about creating forks of a repository and staying calmer during moments I'm confused.

6.  Something that still feels unclear to me or just curious about is what ".md" does when adding it after our names.
